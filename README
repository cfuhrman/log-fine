NAME
    Log::Fine - Yet another logging framework

SYNOPSIS
    Provides fine-grained logging and tracing.

        use Log::Fine;
        use Log::Fine qw( :masks );          # log masks
        use Log::Fine qw( :macros :masks );  # everything

        # grab our logger object
        my $log = Log::Fine->getLogger("foo");

        # register a handle, in this case a handle that logs to console.
        $log->registerHandle( Log::Fine::Handle::Output->new() );

        # log a message
        $log->log(INFO, "Log object successfully initialized");

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Fine provides a logging framework for application developers who
    need a fine-grained logging mechanism in their program(s). By itself,
    Log::Fine provides a mechanism to get one or more logging objects
    (called *loggers*) from its stored namespace. Most logging is then done
    through a logger object that is specific to the application.

  Handlers
    Handlers provides a means to output log messages in one or more ways.
    Currently, the following handles are provided:

    Log::Fine::Handle::Output
        Provides logging to "STDERR" or "STDOUT".

    Log::Fine::Handle::File
        Provides logging to a file.

    Log::Fine::Handle::Syslog
        Provides logging to syslog

    Additional Handlers can be defined to the user's taste.

  Log Levels
    Log::Fine bases its log levels on those found in the Sys::Syslog module.
    For convenience, the following shorthand macros are exported.

    EMER
    ALRT
    CRIT
    ERR
    WARN
    NOTI
    INFO
    DEBG

    Each of these corresponds to the appropriate logging level.

  Masks
    Log masks can be exported for use in setting up individual handles (see
    Log::Fine::Handle). Log::Fine exports the following masks corresponding
    to their log level:

    "LOGMASK_EMERG"
    "LOGMASK_ALERT"
    "LOGMASK_CRIT"
    "LOGMASK_ERR"
    "LOGMASK_WARNING"
    "LOGMASK_NOTICE"
    "LOGMASK_INFO"
    "LOGMASK_DEBUG"

    See Log::Fine::Handle for more information.

  Logging Formats
    By default, log messages are formatted as follows using the Basic
    formatter object.

         [<time>] <LEVEL> <MESSAGE>\n

    For more information on the customization of log messages, please see
    Log::Fine::Formatter.

METHODS
    The Log::Fine module, by itself, simply exports a few constants, and
    allows the developer to get a new logger. After a logger is created,
    further actions are done through the logger object. The following two
    constructors are defined:

  new($hash)
    Creates a new Log::Fine object.

  getLogger($name)
    Creates a logger with the given name. This method can also be used as a
    constructor for a Log::Fine object
