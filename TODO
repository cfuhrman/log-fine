 * Switch to Module::Build?

 * Allow log levels to be definable.

   - Create separate levels method which will handle level classes.
     This will become an attribute of Log::Fine rather than inherited.
   - Once level class has been set, lock it.  Have the following
     method/function:

       # function call
       globalLevelType("Java"); # <-- loads appropriate class

       # oo style call
       $self->globalLevelType("Java");

   - Need to figure out precedence on levels

 * Have a callback for handling log-fine errors?

 * Have Utils handle more than one Logger?

 * Tutorial for defining Log::Fine::Levels sub-classes
