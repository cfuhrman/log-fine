* DONE [#B] Rename Template->_templateValidate()                  :templates:
  CLOSED: [2011-12-02 Fri 12:51]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2011-12-02 Fri 12:52] \\
    Completed.  ~_templateValidate()~ has been replaced with
    ~_placeholderValidate()~

  Rename ~Template->_templateValidate()~ to some other method name
  that has the word 'placeholder' in it.

* CANCELED [#C] Create Log::Fine::Handle::SMTP                      :handles:
  CLOSED: [2012-05-29 Tue 17:10]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2012-05-29 Tue 17:11] \\
    Canceled.  I'm going to subclass this instead.

  Create a new handle for simple email delivery.  This method will use
  the standard Net::SMTP module for email delivery rather than the
  fully-featured Email::Sender module.

* TODO [#A] Re-organize Log::Fine::Handle::Email functionality

  This would work as follows:

  1) User would instantiate a Log::Fine::Handle::Email object,
     optionally passing it the name of the submodule to load

  2) Email handle would then determine the appropriate class to load
     and return the appropriate instance

  3) Note that the default will remain using the Email::Sender module
     for email delivery since it's the most flexible

** Minor API change

    - Addition of hash item "module" to constructor for specifying
      Email module to use. Default will be EmailSender.

    - ~msgWrite()~ must now be subclassed.

* TODO [#C] Brainstorm ideas for LOGFINE-0-61                    :brainstorm:

  Ideally, I'd like to get Log::Fine "enterprise-ready", by adding a
  number of features and improvements aimed at stability

** TODO [#C] Allow for Handle enabling/disabling

   This would involve the addition of the following methods to
   ~Handle.pm~:

    - ~enable()~

    - ~disable()~

   To facilitate this, a Logger object must be able to reference a
   handle by name, so the following changes would have to be made to
   ~Logger.pm~:

    1) Add new method, ~handleByName()~ for retrieving a handle by its
       name.  Would take a string representing a handle name.  If it
       can't find the associated handle, then return undef.

    2) Add new method, ~listHandles()~ for retrieving a list of
       registered handles.

    3) Optionally, just tell the user to keep track of handle names on
       their own.

    Also, ~isLoggable()~ would have to handle enabled or disabled
    handles.

** TODO [#A] Add internal logging method

   Add the ability for Log::Fine to log itself.  By default, use a new
   handle, ~Null~ and log to that (any logging there goes into the
   ether).  The user can specify one or more handles on construction,
   like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC perl
   use Log::Fine;
   use Log::Fine::Handle::Console;
   use Log::Fine::Levels::Syslog qw( :masks );

   my $loghandle =
       Log::Fine::Handle::Console->new(
           name => 'logfine_logger',
           mask => LOGMASK_EMERG | LOGMASK_ALERT | LOGMASK_CRIT,
           use_stderr => 1,
       );

   my $log = Log::Fine->new(int_log_handle => [ $loghandle ]);
   #+END_SRC

   This would create a new internal logger object.

** DONE [#B] Have ~registerHandle()~ accept more than one Handles
   CLOSED: [2012-06-18 Mon 22:53]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-06-18 Mon 22:54] \\
     Added in [[https://github.com/cfuhrman/log-fine/commit/7d4cd749c9b49e94b079511bae30c40aceb25d11#lib/Log/Fine/Logger.pm][7d4cd74]]

   Just need to have ~registerHandle()~ check to see if it's being fed
   an array ref and then make sure all elements in that array are
   ~Handle~ objects.

** DONE [#A] Check File Handles in ~Handle::File~ objects
   CLOSED: [2012-06-18 Mon 22:56]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-06-18 Mon 22:56] \\
     File handles are now checked in [[https://github.com/cfuhrman/log-fine/commit/83192fa5e631daac1310715e05aaea2e51d30a94#lib/Log/Fine/Handle/File.pm][83192fa]]

   Need to make sure we can print and whatnot in ~Handle::File~
   objects.  Might also want to make sure directory exists before we
   instantiate.

** TODO [#C] Make ~Sys::Syslog~ testing optional

   Make ~Sys::Syslog~ testing optional.  This way, I can test
   ~Log::Fine~ on some systems where ~Sys::Syslog~ is either not
   installed or older than version 0.13 (which is the minimally
   required version for ~Log::Fine~).

** DONE [#A] Add ~_error()~ method
   CLOSED: [2012-06-18 Mon 22:56]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-06-18 Mon 22:57] \\
     ~_error()~ added in [[https://github.com/cfuhrman/log-fine/commit/83192fa5e631daac1310715e05aaea2e51d30a94#lib/Log/Fine/Handle/File.pm][83192fa]]

   By default, ~_error()~ method will call ~_fatal()~.
