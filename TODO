#+TODO: TODO BLOCKED | DONE CANCELED

* TODO [#C] Switch to Module::Build

  Unsure if I want to do this or not.  Still need to weigh the
  benefits to doing this

* TODO [#B] Have Utils handle more than one Logger

  Currently L::F::U can handle only one Logger.  Extend API to allow
  for multiple logging objects

* CANCELED [#C] Add tutorial for defining Level sub-classes
  CLOSED: [2010-11-24 Wed 11:54]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2010-11-24 Wed 11:55] \\
    In the rare instances where someone would want to define their own
    level classes, people should be able to figure out the API simply by
    looking at either Syslog or Java subclasses as examples.

* DONE [#A] Document git repository
  CLOSED: [2010-11-24 Wed 11:52]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2010-11-24 Wed 11:53] \\
    See [[https://github.com/cfuhrman/log-fine/commit/26dee0df99b40f315a1ad7ba336e913391b9724e][log-fine/26dee0f]]

  Add note about the new git repository

* TODO [#B] Add Formatter Template class

  Add a template class to allow the user to easily build log message
  templates.  Perhaps use message layout options from [[http://search.cpan.org/dist/Log-Handler/lib/Log/Handler.pm][Log::Handler]]?
