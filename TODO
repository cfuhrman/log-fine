 * Switch to Module::Build?

 * Make Log::Fine inherit from Levels

 * Make sure that inheriting levels doesn't break anything

 * Add support for Masks to Levels

 * Replace getLevels() with listLevels() method call ... may make that
   a functional call as well

 * Have Utils handle more than one Logger?

 * Provide dynamic levels in Utils class?
